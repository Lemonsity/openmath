    This now shows the motivation behind the choice "limit point", when we just looked at the closure isolated points we're part of it, but now they are removed.

        Let \( A \) be a subset of a topological space \( X \), and let \( B = X \setminus A \) then

    <div class="proof">
        This boils down to proving that \( A \cup A ^ \prime = A \sqcup \left( A ^ \prime \cap B \right)   \). This is the case because if we take an element from the left then if it's in \( A \) then it's clearly in the right hand side so assume instead its in \( A ^ \prime  \) then either \( x \in A \) or \( x \notin A \) in either case its an element from right hand side. Taking an element from the right, and disposing of the case of \( x \in A \) similarly then whenever \( x \in A ^ \prime \cap B \) then \( x \in A ^ \prime  \) still so it's an element of the left hand side.

    The above corollary might seem a little useless, but the point of it is to help you be able to find the closure faster, fundamentally this is because you already know that \( \bar A \) will already contain all of \( A \), and thus to find the rest of the closure you just have to inspect elements which are not in \( A \) which are limit points. This reduces your search space when trying to show that a set is closed for example.
