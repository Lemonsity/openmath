    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        <p>Suppose that \( f \) is a homeomorphism, and that \( U \) is a subset of \( X \), assume \( f \left( U \right) \) is open in \( Y \) , we'll prove that \( U \) is open in \( X \), since \( f \) is continuous, then we know that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( f \left( U \right) \right) \) is an open set of \( X \), since \( f \) is a bijection, this means it's injective and thus \( f ^ { -1 } \left( f \left( U \right) \right) = U \) as needed.</p>
        <p>Now suppose that \( U \) is open in \( X \), since we know that \( f ^ { -1 } \) is continuous this means that \( \left( f ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \left( U \right) \) is an open set of \( Y \), <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/functions.html#exercise-inverse-image-of-the-inverse-function-is-the-image">we've shown</a> that \( \left( f ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \left( U \right) = f \left( U \right) \), thus, we've just shown that \( f \left( U \right) \) is an open set of \( Y \), this concludes</p>
        <p>At this point we've proven the main rightward implication. The other direction is quite a lot easier. We have to show that both \( f \) and \( f ^ { -1 } \) are continuous.</p>
        <p>Suppose that \( V \) is an open set of \( Y \), we want to show that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \) is an open set of \( X \), which is true iff \( f \left( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \right) \) is an open set of \( Y \), since \( f \) is surjective, then \( f \left( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \right) = V \) making it an open set of \( Y \), which shows that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \) is an open set of \( X \)</p>
        <p>Now suppose that \( U \) is an open set of \( X \) , our goal will be to show that \( \left( f ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \left( U \right) \) is an open set of \( Y \), as seen previously \( \left( f ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \left( U \right) = f \left( U \right) \), and since \( U \) was open in \( X \), by our assmption we know that \( f \left( U \right) \) is open in \( Y \), this concludes the proof.</p>
