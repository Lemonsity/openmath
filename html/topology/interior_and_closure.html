        <p>Now suppose that \( I \) is finite, and we'll show that \( X \backslash \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} \) is open, we know this set is equal to \( \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} \left ( X \backslash A_{\alpha} \right ) \), and as a finite intersection of open sets, we know it is open as well showing the original set is open</p>
