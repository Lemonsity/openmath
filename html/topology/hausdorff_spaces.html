To show that the space is hausdorff it remains to show that \( U \cap V = \emptyset \), so suppose for the sake of contradiction that there was an element \( d \in U \cap V \) which implies that since \( \left( d, d \right) \in U \times V \) but \( U \times V \subseteq X \times X \setminus \Delta \) which shows that such an element \( d \) is impossible to exist, and therefore we must have \( U \cap V = \emptyset \)</p>

Let \( C = { x_1, \ldots, x_{k + 1} } \) be the \( k + 1 \) elements, let \( C_i = C \setminus \left\{ x_i \right\} \), which produces a set of size \( k \) on which we know the induction hypothesis holds true, and therefore we obtain \( U _ { 1, i }, \ldots , U _ {k, i} \) disjoint open sets such that \( x_j \in U_{j, i} \) for all \( j \neq i \) and lets call the family of these sets by the mask of \( C_i \)</p>
