    Let \((X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)\) be a <a class="knowledge-link" href="/measure_theory/measurable_functions.html#definition-measurable-space">measure space</a>, and let \(\{f_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) be a sequence of <a class="knowledge-link" href="/measure_theory/measurable_functions.html#definition-measurable-function">measurable functions</a> \(f_n: X \to \mathbb{R}\) (or \(\mathbb{C}\)).

    In other words, the sequence \(\{f_n(x)\}\) converges to \(f(x)\) at all points \(x\) except possibly on a set \(N\) where the measure \(\mu(N)\) is zero. This means that the convergence holds "almost everywhere" in \(X\), despite there being potentially a small (measure-zero) set where it may fail to converge. Note that almost everywhere is often abbreviated as a.e.

<h2>ideas to be organized into the above</h2>
<p>
The notation \( L_\mu^2(X) \) represents the **space of square-integrable functions** on a measure space \( (X, \mathcal{F}, \mu) \). Which are functions \( f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \) (or \( \mathbb{R} \)) such that:
    \[
    \int_X |f(x)|^2 \, d\mu < \infty.
    \]
    This means that the squared absolute value of \( f \) is integrable with respect to the measure \( \mu \).
</p>
<hr>
<p>
The differential \( d\mu \) in an integral \( \int_X f \, d\mu \) indicates that the integration is taken with respect to the measure \( \mu \). The integral \( \int_X f \, d\mu \) is defined as a limit (or sum) over measurable "slices" of \( X \) rather than just points. Formally, for a non-negative measurable function \( f: X \rightarrow [0, \infty] \), the integral with respect to \( d\mu \) is defined as
\[
\int_X f \, d\mu = \sup \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \, \mu(A_i) : \{A_i\}_{i=1}^n \text{ is a finite measurable partition of } X \right\}.
\]
This expression takes a supremum over all possible finite partitions of \( X \) into measurable sets \( A_i \) with \( x_i \in A_i \) and \( \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \, \mu(A_i) \) providing an approximation of the integral over each slice weighted by \( \mu(A_i) \).
