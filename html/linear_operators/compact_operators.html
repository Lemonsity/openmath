        Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be normed spaces. A linear transformation \(T \in L(X, Y)\) is compact if, for any bounded sequence \( \left( x _ n \right)  \) in \(X\), the sequence \( \left( T x _ n \right) \) in \(Y\) contains a convergent subsequence.

            \( \implies  \) If \( T \) is assumed compact and \( \left( x _ n \right)  \) is bounded ie) the set \( \operatorname{ im } \left( x _ n \right) =   \left\{ x _ n : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\}  \) is bounded, and therefore \( \overline{ T \left( \operatorname{ im } \left( x _ n \right)   \right) }   \) is compact in \( Y \) and <a class="knowledge-link" href="/linear_operators/banach_spaces.html#definition-sequential-compactness-of-a-metric-space">therefore</a> contains a convergent subsequence

Our goal is to show that given any bounded subset \( B \subseteq X \) we must show that \( \overline{ T \left( B \right)  }  \) is compact, but recall that <a class="knowledge-link" href="/topology/connectedness_and_compactness.html#proposition-every-compact-subspace-of-a-metric-space-is-closed-and-bounded">every compact set is closed</a> as we are working in a metric space induced by the norm, therefore if we prove that \( T \left( B \right)  \) is compact, then it is closed so that \( T \left( B  \right) = \overline{ T \left( B \right)  }   \) showing that \( \overline{ T \left( B \right)  }  \) is compact.

            So moving towards this given any bounded subset \( B \subseteq X \), let \( \left( y _ n \right)  \) be any sequence in \( T \left( B \right)  \). Then \( y _ n = T x _ n \) for some sequence \( \left( x _n  \right)  \) in \( B \). Since \( B \) was bounded, then so is \( \left( x _ n \right)  \) , therefore by our assumption we know \( \left( T x _ n \right)  \) contains a convergent subsequence, that is \( \left( y _ n \right)  \) contains a convergent subsequence <a class="knowledge-link" href="/linear_operators/banach_spaces.html#definition-sequential-compactness-of-a-metric-space">therefore</a> \( T \left( B \right)  \) is compact, and as discussed this shows that \( \overline{ T \left( B \right)  }  \) is compact.

        Suppose that \(T\) is not bounded. Then for each integer \(n \geq 1\) there exists a unit vector \(x_n\) such that \(\left\|T x_n\right\| \geq n\). Since the sequence \(\left\{x_n\right\}\) is bounded, by the compactness of \(T\) there exists a subsequence \(\left\{T x_{n(r)}\right\}\) which converges.

In other words, there exists an orthonormal basis for \(\mathcal{H}\) which consists of eigenvectors for both \(T\) and \(S\).
    </div>

    <div class="proof">
        Suppose \(\lambda_i\) are the collection of eigenvalues of \(T\) and \(E_{\lambda_i}\left(T\right)\) are the corresponding eigenspaces. Then we will show that an orthogonal collection in \(E_{\lambda_i}\) also are eigenvectors of \(S\). Suppose that \(f_1, f_2, \ldots f_n\) forms a basis for \(E_\lambda\), then
        \[
        T f_j=\lambda_1 f_j .

        So that,
        \[
        T S f_j=S T f_j=\lambda S f_j,

        i.e., \(S f_j \in E_\lambda\left(T\right)\), i.e.
        \[
        S f_j=\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_{i, j} f_i

        Thus, \(S: E_\lambda \rightarrow E_\lambda\) can be represented as an \(n \times n\) matrix with entries \(\alpha_{i, j}\). From the symmetry of \(S\), it follows that \(\alpha_{i, j}=\alpha_{j, i}\) and thus, the orthogonal matrix has a collection of orthogonal eigenvectors of the mapping \(S\). This, shows that every eigenvector of \(T\) with eigenvalue not equal to 0 is also an eigenvector of \(S\). For \(\lambda=0\), a similar proof shows that \(S: \operatorname{ null } \left(T\right) \rightarrow \operatorname{ null } \left(T\right)\) and it follows from the spectral theorem, that there exists an orthogonal basis of \( \operatorname{ null } \left(T\right)\) which are the eigenvectors of \(S\) too.

            Define the real part \( A \) and imaginary part \( B \) of \( T \) as follows:

            We now show that \( A \) and \( B \) are self-adjoint, we verify that \( A^* = A \) and \( B^* = B \).
            \[
            A^* = \left( \frac{T + T^*}{2} \right)^* = \frac{T^* + (T^*)^*}{2} = \frac{T^* + T}{2} = A.
