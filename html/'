        <p>
            Out of the gate, first be sure to note that \( F \circ \alpha \) for any path \( \alpha \) is still a path, as it remains continuous as the composition of two continuous functions and still maps out of \( \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \). Now we start by supposing that \( \gamma _ a \sim \gamma _b \), ie there exists some <a class="knowledge-link" href="/topology/algebraic_topology.html#definition-path-homotopic">homotopy</a> \( H \) between them going from \( \gamma _ a \) to \( \gamma _b \).

        <p>
            Now to show that \( F \circ \gamma _a  \) and \( F \circ \gamma _ b \) are homotopic, we just have to construct a function \( G : I \times I \to Y \) with the required properties of a homotopy, but if we simply do \( G \left( s, t \right) = F \left( H \left( s, t \right)  \right)   \) which is continuous as a composition of continuous functions, then we can verify that:
            \[
              G \left( s, 0 \right) = F \left( H \left( s, 0 \right)  \right) = F \left( \gamma _ a \left( s \right)  \right) = F \circ \gamma _ a \left( s \right) 
            \] 
            and similarly 
            \[
              G \left( s, 1 \right) = F \left( H \left( s, 1 \right)  \right) = F \left( \gamma _ b \left( s \right)  \right) = F \circ \gamma _ b \left( s \right)

            also
            \[
              G \left( 0, t \right) = F \left( H \left( 0, t \right)  \right) = F \left( \gamma _ a \left( 0 \right)  \right) = F \circ \gamma _ a \left( 0 \right) 
            \] 
            and finally that 
            \[
              G \left( 1, t \right) = F \left( H \left( 1, t \right)  \right) = F \left( \gamma _ a \left( 1 \right)  \right) = F \circ \gamma _ a \left( 1 \right)

            Suppose that \( A, B, C : X \to Y \) are continuous, first we prove reflexivity, so we show that \( A \sim A \), to do so we must construct a continuous function between them as specified <a class="knowledge-link" href="/topology/algebraic_topology.html#definition-homotopic-functions">here</a>, but we can take \( H \left( x, t \right) = A \left( x \right)   \) which satisfies the requirements and is also continuous as its equal to \( A \).
        </p>
        <p>
            Now suppose that \( A \sim B \) and let's prove that \( B \sim A \), since \( A \sim B \) then we know that there exists \( H : X \times \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to Y  \) such that \( H \left( x, 0 \right) = A \left( x \right)   \) and \( H \left( x, 1 \right) = B \left( x \right)  \), then all we have to is consider the function \( H ^ \prime \left( x, t \right) = H \left( x, 1 - t \right)   \) which is still continuous with the desired properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally suppose that \( A \sim B \) and that \( B \sim C \) we must prove \( A \sim C \) to show that transitivity still holds true, so now we have \( H _ 1 , H _ 2 \) between the previous two respectively, thus in the same way as we've proven it for path's we construct 
            \[
              H \left( x, t \right) = 
            \begin{cases}
                H _ 1 \left( x, 2t \right) &\text{ if } t \le \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \\
                H _ 2 \left( x, 2t - 1 \right) &\text{ if } t \ge \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }
            \end{cases}

             \( 1 \Rightarrow 2\) Suppose \(f: S^1 \rightarrow  X\). By hypothesis, there's a homotopy \(H: S^1 \times I \rightarrow\) \(X\) from \(f\) to a constant map. That is, \(H \left( s, 0 \right) = f \left( s \right) \) and there is a point \(x \in X\) such that, for all \(s \in S^1, H\left(s,  1\right)=x\). Because of the latter condition, \( H \) factors through the quotient \(S^1 \times I / S^1 \times\{1\}\), which is to say there exists a function \( \widetilde{H} : S ^ 1 \times I \setminus S ^ 1 \times \left\{ 1 \right\} \to X  \) such that \( H = \widetilde{H} \circ q \) where the \( q \)  is the quotient map.

            Note that the pair \(\left(S^1 \times I / S^1 \times\{1\}, S^1 \times\{0\}\right)\) is homeomorphic to \(\left(D^2 , S^1\right) \), the homeomorphism is given by the map \(\phi : S^1 \times I \rightarrow D^2\) defined by \(\phi\left(a,  x\right)= a \cdot(1-x) \), where we look at \(a\) and \(x\) as complex numbers. Therefore \( \widetilde{H} \)  gives a map \(D^2 \rightarrow X\) such that the restriction to \(S^1\) is equal to \(f\)

            \( 2 \Rightarrow 3\) 

            Suppose that every map \( \lambda : S ^ 1 \to  X \) extends to a map \( \lambda ^ \prime : D \to X \), now let \( p \in X _ 0 \) and suppose that \( \gamma  \) is a loop based at \( p \), since the mapp \( f \left( x \right) = e ^ { 2 \pi  i x }  \) is a quotient map, then we obtain some \( \widetilde{ \gamma } : S ^ 1 \to X \) such that \( \gamma = \widetilde{\gamma } \circ f \), moreover \( \widetilde{ \gamma } \) is continouous, and therefore it extends to a map \( \widehat{\gamma } ^ \prime : D \to X \). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since \( D \) is a convex set, then we may construct the straight line homotopy from the constant loop \( c _ p \) and the loop \( f : \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to S ^ 1 \subseteq D  \) where we consider \( f \) as a function into \( D \). Denote this homotopy as \( H : I \times I \to D \) and consider the composite map \( \widetilde{\gamma } ^ \prime  \circ H : I \times I \to X \) 
            \[
            \begin{align*}

                & \widetilde{\gamma}^\prime \circ H(s, 1)=\widetilde{\gamma} \circ H(s, 1)=\widetilde{\gamma} \circ f(s)= \gamma (s), \\

        and is therefore a path homotopy from \(c_p\) to \( \gamma \).

            \( 3 \Rightarrow 1\) We assume that there is some \( x _ 0 \in X \) such that \( \pi _ 1 \left( X, x_0 \right) = \left\{ e \right\}   \), now suppose that \( \lambda : S ^ 1 \to X \) is continous, we want to show that it is a homotopic to a constant function. If we consider the continuous composition: \( \lambda \circ f:  \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to X \) where \( f \left( x \right) = e ^ { 2 \pi i x }  \) then it is a loop in \( X \) and is therefore homotopic to the constant path \( c \). We also know that \( f \times \operatorname{ id } :I \times I \to S ^ 1 \times I \) is a quotient map by the closed map theorem since it is closed surjective and continuous. Thus we obtain a map \( \widetilde{H} : S ^ 1 \times I \to X \) which is a homotopy between \( \lambda  \) and the constant map sending \( S ^ 1 \) to \( x _ 0 \)

            To see why we note that \( H \left( s, t \right) = \widetilde{H} \left( f \left( s \right), t  \right)  \), and then it can be shown that the equation \( \widetilde{H} \left( s, t \right) = H \left( f ^ { -1 } \left( \left\{ s \right\}  \right), t  \right) \) (noting that all images and pre-images only ever return sets with one element), so we have \( \widetilde{H} \left( x, 0 \right) = H \left( f ^ { -1 } \left( \left\{ x \right\}  \right), 0  \right) = \lambda \circ f \left( f ^ { -1 } \left( \left\{ x \right\}  \right)  \right) = \lambda \left( x \right)  \), similarly the other equations hold true.

    Note that the above allows us to deduce that a space \(X\) is simply-connected iff all maps \(S^1 \rightarrow X\) are homotopic. [In this problem, "homotopic" means "homotopic without regard to basepoints".] This exercise essentially shows that a space is simply-connected if and only if it has no "holes".

    <div class="content">
        Any function \( \lambda : S ^ 1 \to S ^ 2 \) is homotopic to a continuous \( \lambda _ 0 : S ^ 1 \to S ^ 2 \) which is not surjective
    </div>

    <div class="proof">
        <p>
            We first make the observation that \( S ^ 2 \) can be covered by 6 open half-spheres \( \left\{ U_1, U_2, \ldots , U _ 6 \right\}  \)  placed onto the sphere as if it was a cube with 6 sides. If we set \( h \left( x \right) = e ^ { i 2 \pi x }  \) then we see that \( G := \lambda \circ h : \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to S ^ 2  \) and that \( \left\{ G ^ { -1 } \left( U_ i \right)  \right\}  \) is an open cover of \( \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \), since it is compact, then by the lebesgue number lemma there exists some \( \delta \gt 0 \) such that for each subset of \( \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \) having length less than \( \delta  \) there is an element in the open cover containing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            So now we make an equally spaced partition of \( \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \) of size \( n \) chosen large enough ie \( \frac{ 1 }{ n } \lt \delta  \) so that each sub-interval has size less than \( \delta  \), and let these intervals be denoted by \( I _ 1, I _2 , \ldots , I _ n \), again by the lebesgue number lemma, for any such interval \( I _ j \) we know that there exists a \( G ^ { -1 } \left( U _ m \right)  \) (where \( m \in [6] \)) that contains \( I _ j \) completely. On the other hand this implies that \( G \left( I _ j \right) = \lambda \circ h \left( I _ j \right) \subseteq U _ m  \). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly note that each half sphere is homeomorphic with \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 2 \) which is simply connected. Now can think of \( G | _ { I _ j } \) as being its own path from the sub-interval into \( S ^ 2 \) and with the above fact, then we know this path along the surface of \( S ^ 2 \) with endpoints \( a, b \in U _ m \), as it is simply connected, then we know that the path of the great circle connecting \( a, b  \) is contained within \( U _ m \) and that the great circle path and the sub-interval path are homeomorphic.
        </p>
        <p>
            By repeating this process for each \( I _ k \) we obtain a sequence of great circle paths connecting each of the endpoints, by concatenating them we obtain a path \( C \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to S ^ 2  \) that is homotopic to the path given by \( G = \lambda \circ h \), but it should be clear that a finite union of great circle paths can never cover \( S ^ 2 \). Since \( C : \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to S ^ 1   \) and \( h : \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to S ^ 1  \) is a quotient map then we obtain some function \( c : S ^ 1 \to S ^ 2 \) such that \( c \circ h = C \), in other words we know that \( c \circ h \)  and \( \lambda \circ h \) are path homotopic, showing that \( c \) and \( \lambda  \) are homotopic as functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            But since \( C \left( \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \right) = c \circ h \left( \left[ 0, 1 \right] \right)   \) which is equal to the path which is a finite number of great circle segments concatenated which we already found out does not cover \( S ^ 2 \), then also since \( h \) is surjective then \( c \circ h \left( \infty 0, 1 \right) = c \left( S _ 1 \right)    \)  showing that \( c \) is not surjective, thus  \( \lambda  \) is homotopic to a function \( c : S ^ 1 \to S ^ 2  \) which is not surjective as needed.

    <div class="proof">
        <p>
            We start by proving that given a continuous function \( \lambda _ 0 : S ^ 1 \to S ^ 2 \) that is not surjective is homotopic to a constant function, since \( \lambda _ 0 \) is not surjective, then there exists a point \( p  \) that is never reached by \( \lambda _ 0 \). Now we know that \( S ^ 2 \setminus \left\{ p \right\} \) is homeomorphic to \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 2 \) via the stereographic projection \( \phi \)  and that \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 2 \) is simply connected, if we take \( f \left( t \right) = e ^ { 2 pi i t }  \) then we know that \( \lambda \circ f : \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to S ^ 2  \) is a loop, and is thus homotopic to a constant path \( C : \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to S ^ 2  \)  given by the path homotopy \( H \). Since \( f \left( x \right)  \) is a quotient map as noted earlier so we obtain some \( c : S ^ 1 \to S ^ 2 \) such that \( C = c \circ f \) so that we know the paths \( \lambda \circ f \) and \( c \circ f \) are homotopic, since \( f \) is surjective, then we can conclude that \( c \) itself is constant, and also then that \( \lambda  \) and \( c \) are homotopic, as needed.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Note that we have shown that every continuous function from \( S ^ 1 \to S ^ 2 \) is homotopic to the constant function, and therefore by what we showed in the previous question we conclude that \( S ^ 2 \) is connected.

        If \(\pi:\left(E, e_0\right) \rightarrow\left(B, b_0\right)\) is a covering map, then for all paths \(\gamma: I \rightarrow B\) with \(\gamma(0)=b_0\), there exists a unique map \(\tilde{\gamma}: I \rightarrow E\) lifting \(\gamma\) with \(\tilde{\gamma}(0)=e_0\).
    </div>

    <div class="proof">
        <p>
            Let \(\mathcal{O}\) be a covering of \(B\) by good neighborhoods. Then \(\left\{\gamma^{-1}(U): U \in \mathcal{O}\right\}\) is an open cover of \(I\) and hence has a Lebesgue number. Thus we can decompose \(I\) into subintervals \(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\) where \( 0=t_0\lt t_1 \lt \cdots \lt t_{n-1} \lt t_n = 1 \) such that \(\gamma\left(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\right)\) is contained in some good neighborhood for \(i=0, \ldots, n-1\).
        </p>
        <p>
            We will build \(\tilde{\gamma}\) inductively. If \(\gamma([0, t]) \subseteq V\) for some good neighborhood and \(\pi^{-1}(V)=\cup_{\alpha \in I} V_\alpha\), suppose \(e_0 \in V_0\) (one of the \(V_\alpha\) 's). Define \(\tilde{\gamma}_{[0, t]}=\left(\left.\pi\right|_{V_0}\right)^{-1} \circ \gamma\) (as \(\left.\pi\right|_{V_0}\) is a homeomorphism, this makes sense). Having defined \(\tilde{\gamma}\) on \(\left[0, t_i\right]\), do the same for \(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]:\) If \(\gamma\left(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\right) \subseteq U\) for some good neighborhood and \(\gamma\left(\tilde{t}_i\right)=x \in U_0\) for one of the parts of \(\pi^{-1}(U)\), define \(\left.\tilde{\gamma}\right|_{\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]}=\left(\left.\pi\right|_{U_0}\right)^{-1} \circ \gamma\). Then \(\tilde{\gamma}\) defined this way is continuous by the Pasting Lemma and is a lift of \(\gamma\) by construction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose now \(\tilde{\gamma}, \tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}\) are two lifts of \(\gamma\) with \(\tilde{\gamma}(0)=e_0=\tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}(0)\). Suppose they agree on \(\left[0, t_i\right]\) for some \(i=0, \ldots, n\) (certainly true for \(i=0\) ). On \(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\), there is a good neighborhood of \(V\) with \(\gamma\left(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\right) \subseteq V\) and \(\tilde{\gamma}\left(t_i\right)=\tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}\left(t_i\right) \in V_0\), one of the parts of \(\pi^{-1}(V)\). We have \(\tilde{\gamma}\left(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\right), \tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}\left(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\right) \subseteq \pi^{-1}(V)\) which has a separation \(\left\{V_0, \pi^{-1}(V) \backslash V_0\right\}\).
        </p>
        <p>
            Since \(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\) is connected, we see \(\tilde{\gamma}\left(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\right), \tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}\left(\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]\right) \subseteq V_0\). So \(\left.\left.\pi\right|_{V_0} \circ \tilde{\gamma}\right|_{\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]}=\left.\left.\pi\right|_{V_0} \circ \tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}\right|_{\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]}\). As \(\left.\pi\right|_{V_0}\) is invertible, we see \(\left.\tilde{\gamma}\right|_{\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]}=\left.\tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}\right|_{\left[t_i, t_{i+1}\right]}\). By induction, \(\bar{\gamma}=\tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}\).

        For the converse, we define \(\tilde{f}\) as follows: let \(y \in Y\) and let \(\gamma: y_0 \rightarrow y\) be a path. Then take the path \(f \gamma\) and lift it at \(\tilde{x}_0\), giving \(\widetilde{f \gamma}\). Define \(\tilde{f}(y)=\widetilde{f} \gamma(1)\).
        \(\tilde{f}\) is well defined, independent of \(\gamma\) : if we choose \(\gamma^{\prime}: y_0 \rightarrow y\), then \(\left(f \gamma^{\prime}\right)(f \gamma)^{-1}\) is a loop \(h_0\) in the image of \(f_*\) and hence is homotopic (via \(h_t\) ) to a loop \(h_1\) which lifts to a loop \(\tilde{h}_1\) at \(\tilde{x}_0\). But the homotopy lifts, and hence \(\tilde{h}_0\) is a loop as well. By uniqueness of lifted paths, \(\tilde{h}_0\) consists of \(\widetilde{f \gamma^{\prime}}\) and \(\widetilde{f \gamma}\) (both lifted at \(\tilde{x}_0\) ), traversed as a loop. Since they form a loop, it must be that \(\widetilde{f \gamma^{\prime}}(1)=\widetilde{f \gamma}(1)\).
        \(\tilde{f}\) is continuous: We show that each \(y \in Y\) has a neighbourhood \(V\) small enough that \(\left.\tilde{f}\right|_V\) coincides with \(f\). Take a neighbourhood \(U\) of \(f(y)\) which lifts to \(\tilde{f}(y) \in \tilde{U} \subset \bar{X}\) via \(p: \tilde{U} \longrightarrow U\). Then choose a path-connected neighbourhood \(V\) of \(y\) with \(f(V) \subset U\). Fix a path \(\gamma\) from \(y_0\) to \(y\) and then for any point \(y^{\prime} \in V\) choose path \(\eta: y \rightarrow y^{\prime}\). Then the paths \((f \gamma)(f \eta)\) have lifts \(\widetilde{f \gamma} \widetilde{f \eta}\), and \(\widetilde{f \eta}=p^{-1} f \eta\). Hence \(\tilde{f}(V) \subset \tilde{U}\) and \(\left.\tilde{f}\right|_V=p^{-1} f\), hence continuous.
